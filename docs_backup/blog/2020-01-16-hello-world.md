Hi there, and welcome to this blog.

<!--truncate-->

[Lionel][twitter-lionel] and I ([Farzad][twitter-farzad]) are long-time
cloud practitioners, and today we feel an urge to share our findings
with the community. So, here we are.  
We will mostly write about Amazon Web Services, but not only. We will
sometimes go deep in detail and sometimes only scratch the surface. We
will try to publish regularly, but sometimes we just won't.  
We are French, so also expect some writings in our native language, Le
Code, on [GitHub][github-lifadev].

Can't wait :3
